# Cpt.Flint-Ch10-SVGlogoGenerator

## Description

This app is designed to create a command-line application that takes user input for text, shape, and color to generate an SVG logo in the form of a logo.svg file containing a 300x200 pixel image. This is achieved by importing constructor classes form a separate shapes.js file, with an accompanying shapes.test.js that utilizes jest for testing the functionality. In coding this project I gained invaluable experience using constructor classes and tests.
